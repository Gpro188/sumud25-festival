# Admin Password Change and Team Leader Credentials Management

This document summarizes the implementation of admin password change functionality and team leader credentials display in the SUMUD'25 Festival system.

## Features Implemented

1. **Admin Password Change**
   - Created admin profile page with secure password change functionality
   - Password validation (minimum 6 characters)
   - Current password verification before allowing changes
   - Success and error messaging

2. **Team Leader Credentials Management**
   - Display of team leader usernames in the admin teams management page
   - Secure credential viewing through modal dialogs
   - Explanation of password security practices
   - Guidance on resetting passwords when needed

## Files Created

### 1. admin_profile.php
Location: Project root directory
Purpose: Admin profile management with password change functionality

Key features:
- Secure password change with current password verification
- Form validation for new passwords
- Success/error feedback messages
- Admin profile information display

### 2. teams_with_secure_credentials.php
Location: Project root directory
Purpose: Enhanced teams management page with secure credential display

Key features:
- Team leader username display in table format
- Modal-based credential viewing
- Security-focused password information (explains that passwords are hashed)
- Guidance on using the password reset feature
- Integration with existing team leader management features

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Storage**
   - All passwords are securely hashed using PHP's password_hash() function
   - Plain text passwords are never stored or displayed
   - Password verification uses password_verify() for secure comparison

2. **Credential Display**
   - Actual passwords are never displayed for security reasons
   - Users are informed about password security practices
   - Clear guidance on using the password reset feature when credentials are needed

3. **Session Management**
   - Both features maintain existing session-based authentication
   - Proper session validation before allowing access to admin features

## Implementation Details

### Admin Password Change
The admin profile page allows administrators to change their own password by:
1. Verifying their current password
2. Setting a new password (with confirmation)
3. Updating the database with the new hashed password

### Team Leader Credentials
The teams management page now includes:
1. A "View" button for each team leader that opens a modal
2. Display of the team leader's username
3. Security information about password storage
4. Guidance on using the password reset feature

## Usage Instructions

### For Admin Password Change
1. Navigate to the admin profile page
2. Enter current password
3. Enter and confirm new password
4. Submit the form to update password

### For Team Leader Credentials
1. Navigate to the "Manage Teams" section in admin panel
2. Click the "View" button in the Credentials column for any team leader
3. View the username in the modal that appears
4. Use the "Reset Password" feature if login credentials need to be provided

   - Place `admin_profile.php` in the admin directory
   - Add a link to the profile page in the admin navigation menu
